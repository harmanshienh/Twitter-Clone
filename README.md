# Twitter-Clone
A frontend twitter clone made with React.js and CSS, hosted on Firebase.
There is extra functionality to choose a colour theme using a colour picker. By selecting a background colour, the other colours within the website are dynamically changed to ensure legibility and excellent visual design.
Users also have the ability to post tweets to the timeline through the Tweetbox at the top of the page. This acts as a collective feed for all users of the website.
